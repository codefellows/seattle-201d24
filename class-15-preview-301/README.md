## Today's Plan: Week 3, Friday Lecture... LAST CLASS DAY!

**Campus Schedule for Today**

- **9:00-9:30am:** Brook Riggio, our VP of Education, will lead a discussion on the "What Google Learned About Teams" article that was our reading assignment for today.
- **9:30-11:45:** Last lecture for this class!
- **12:15-1:15**: [Partner Power Hour](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/partner-power-hour-company-t-shirts-finding-something-that-fits-tickets-36325197644): Augustus Lidaka of Pivotal Labs presents *"Company T-shirts: Finding Something That Fits"*
- **1:30-3:00pm** (optional): Python 401 Final Presentations!
	- Try to catch at least a couple of them!
	- See what final Py401 projects look like and what all is happening in them!
	- It's a good chance to observe presentations as presentations, too, since you'll be doing one yourselves in a week!
	- Expect that Sam will be watching those presentations, so when you need him this afternoon, check there first.

**Announcements**

  - Reminder: weekly surveys will go out to students today. As always, thank you for your feedback!
  - Starting at 9:00a on Monday morning is a blackout window on submitting classwork (including late assignments and any resubmissions) during Project Week. In other words, you should be **100%** focused on your project during Project Week. But for the rest of the week, do not spend energy on catching up on past assignments.
  - You'll have the weekend after project presentations to turn in any lingering late work or resubmissions. The deadline for that will be Sunday 8/6 at 11:59pm.
  - The instructional staff will go into the gradebook and "zero out" any previously unsubmitted assignments today. This is not punitive or permanent (you can still submit/resubmit!), just an administrative step to show you ongoing exactly where your grade stands if you do not submit any additional assignments or do any resubmits of previous assignments.
  - Note that during project week as you submit (or if you don't!) your daily project reports and learning journal entries, your grade will move up or down accordingly.

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 15 of Code 201, students will:

- Have an understanding of the fundamentals of Code 301 topics, as measured by observations from the instructional staff during class discussion.
- Have an understanding of how to successfully integrate Git and GitHub into a team code project, as measured by successful completion of the final project.

## Readings

- No readings for today! But keep in mind it is time to start getting into the habit of doing regular daily reading of tech articles, Twitter feeds, and other resources. A great time to do this: on your commute if you bus or train or whatever. And if you drive, there's podcasts! Always Be Learning!

- Here is something you should read at some point over the weekend: [What Google Learned From Its Quest To Build The Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html). Consider how you will respect the emotional safety of everyone on your team to create the best possible team dynamic.
